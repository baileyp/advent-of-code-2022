# Advent of Code 2022

These are my solutions for the [2022 Advent of Code puzzles](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

## Requirements

 1. Python 3
 
## Setup

None

## Running

Just use `python` to run the `aoc` module.

To run Day 1, Part 1 with the input I received:

```bash
$ python -m aoc 1 1
```

Or you can run it with any input file

```bash
$ python -m aoc 1 1 path/to/input/file.txt
```

Or you can run it with input directly as an argument

```bash
$ python -m aoc 1 1 abcdefg
```

## Goals

Unlike past years, I am not setting out to document what I'm doing terribly well, or write Big-O notes, or anything
like that. I just don't program much anymore, and I'm doing this for fun like one might do the crossword with their
coffee in the morning. Also trying not to forget too much of what I've learned about Python.
