# Advent of Code 2022

These are my solutions for the [2020 Advent of Code puzzles](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

## Requirements

 1. Python 3
 
## Setup

None

## Running

Just use `python` to run the `aoc` module.

To run Day 1, Part 1 with the input I received:

```bash
$ python -m aoc 1 1
```

Or you can run it with any input file

```bash
$ python -m aoc 1 1 path/to/input/file.txt
```

Or you can run it with input directly as an argument

```bash
$ python -m aoc 1 1 abcdefg
```
